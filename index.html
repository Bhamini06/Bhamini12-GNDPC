        <h3>ABOUT SCHOOL</h3>
    </a>

    <p>
        Established in 1978 Nankana Sahib Public School is a proud member of Nankana Sahib Education Trust running 16
        educational institutions including 11 Schools, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Guru Nanak Dev Polytechnic,
        Training College at Kot Gangu Rai, Community Development & Training Centre, Science & Technology Entrepreneur’s
        Park. Ever since its inception, it was led by missionaries, visionaries, and academicians with the purpose of
        imparting education to rural children on the public school pattern.
        It is a matter of great pride that our students can successfully compete with urban children and can mark their
        entry into professional colleges and public services. With a sprawling campus spreading over 15 acres of land
        the school caters to 60 villages around Ludhiana.

        Affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education New Delhi Vide Aff. No.1630044 the medium of instruction in
        the school is English. However, languages of Punjabi and Hindi are taught being Regional and National language
        as compulsory subjects. While following the latest guidelines by CBSE the stress is laid on “learning by doing”.

        With a spirit of service, the school strives for the holistic development of the students. The environment of
        freedom and personal responsibility provides the student’s wings of ambition. Looking beyond the geographical
        boundaries the school arranges international tours on a regular basis which provides exposure to the students.
        Adding to it the school has tie-up with 14 universities of Canada for fulfilling the wish of senior students who
        want to study abroad.

        Education is not merely a duty here but an ethical responsibility for us. The emphasis is laid on mutual respect
        for diverse cultures and faiths. The philosophy of the school is based on sympathy and compassion towards the
        suffering lot of humanity, creating awareness that students of today are leaders of tomorrow in all sphere of
        life and visualization of change as the pre-requisite for all human beings.

        The school curriculum provides a vital role in shaping the students as per the philosophy of the institution.
        The objective behind this is helping the students to achieve academic excellence, inculcating social skills,
        emotional maturity, promoting the pursuit of knowledge, and lifelong creativity, polishing the aesthetic senses
        by encouraging students for art, culture, and literature. More importantly, nurturing among students
        intellectual flexibility and psychological fortitude so as to open up the minds of our aspirants in fast
        changing demands of globalization.

        For achieving all this, the curriculum design is based on various skills including life skills, artistic,
        literary, and auditory skills. To evaluate students, the CCE system is adopted in true spirit. All students
        participate in various activities and use PowerPoint Presentations regularly. Students are actively involved in
        the learning process. True learning happens only when students think independently. To foster this all the
        activities and functions of the school are managed and organized by students.
